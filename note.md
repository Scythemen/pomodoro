# The Pomodoro Technique
The Pomodoro Technique was developed in the late 1980s by then university student Francesco Cirillo. 

- Get a to-do list and a timer.
- Set your timer for 25 minutes, and focus on a single task until the timer rings.
- When your session ends, mark off one pomodoro and record what you completed.
- Then enjoy a five-minute break.
- After four pomodoros, take a longer, more restorative 15-30 minute break.
